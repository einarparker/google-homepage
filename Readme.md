Build copy of the Google search web page.
Work on aligment of elements, centering search bar, top level navbar, footer.
Feel like I spend too much time on this project but it was not time lost.
Went trough many tutorials on flexbox and grid even thou google site is different,
I am quiet happy with my first "swim" in the deep waters.
I do not like how footer is not reducing its size properly, having squashing all the
link items together.
Also search bar does not chage its size whilr resizing the window.
I bet its a quick fix but now I want to move forward. I will try to figure this problems out
during next challenges.

Time well spent on this one.
